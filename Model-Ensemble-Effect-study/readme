# Model-Ensemble-effect-study
Among the Model Ensemble methods, the averaging method that averages the prediction results of models (submission in Kaggle) is often used because it is simple but unexpected performance improvement is possible. 
To prove this, the following experiment was conducted. 
By combining submissions, we made an averaging result, and submitted it to Kaggle to see how much performance improved (that is, improvement of leaderboard score).
- Arithmetic mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, and power mean were applied respectively. 
However, it was confirmed through repeated experiments on various combinations.
- It was also checked whether the averaging effect was different according to the regression problem and the classification problem (or RMSE and AUC).
